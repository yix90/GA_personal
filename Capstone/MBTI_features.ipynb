    "    \n",
    "    Some URLs that have been extracted happen to be concatenated successively without any separator in between.\n",
    "    For example, a URL containing the following 'https://www.youtu.be/blahblahhttp://neninenipoopoo...'\n",
    "    The function iterates through the URLs, identify the URL of the above kind then separates them.\n",
    "    After separation, the concatenated string is then removed and the two separated URLs are added into the list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    End result: 'https://www.youtu.be/blahblah' 'http://neninenipoopoo...'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Additionally, there are also URLs which are incomplete i.e. 'http://',\n",
    "    we will check both of the processed ones and drop them accordingly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This function returns the new list after the processing.\n",
    "    Unfortunately there may exist multiple (more than 2) concatenated URLs and I still do not yet have the brain to process\n",
