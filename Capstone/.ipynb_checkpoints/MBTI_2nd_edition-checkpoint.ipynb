    "Here is another publicly available document set of MBTI classified dataset (lucky me some more!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that the data is labeled differently. Instead of the type displayed outright, the approach is to model with a base function and a directed function. This is another appproach to MBTI typology with their own set of explanations, but I will shall explain very briefly for purpose of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, for every MBTI type, there is a dominant and auxillary personality function pair accompanying it, which can be determined simply by looking at the MBTI type. A personality function is derived from the Sensing/Intuitive and Thinking/Feeling type, and for each of the two pairs they have an extraverted and introverted side. So for example, a person who has Sensing as a dominant trait can have either extraverted sensing or introverted sensing trait, denoted by Se or Si. Same goes for one with a Feeling dominant trait, either Fe or Fi. Whether a person has Se or Si is determined by their Judging/Perceiving trait. For one with a dominant Judging trait, their S/N would be introverted (Si and Ni) while their T/F would be extraverted (Te and Fe). The opposite goes for a dominant Perceiving trait. For example, an SFJ person would have Si and Fe personality functions. Last but not least, E/I determines which of them is dominant/auxillary, so for the ESFJ person he/she would have Fe as dominant and Si as auxillary, the other way around for an ISFJ person. This is but a write-up detailing the simple derivation of personality function pairs from the MBTI type, do read it up if you wish to find out more (this is a Jupyter notebook write-up, I will spoonfeed you here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A little unfortunately for us the dataset only displays the directed function (which we shall assume to be the dominant personality function) so the data is not so 'complete', but with the method detailed from the previous paragraph we can determine at least 3 of the 4 personality type pairs from each data point."

Pa- last lear, Ma- sunglasses… এবং Aishwarya- choker bali, raincoat and me- Antarmahal <semic> অভিষেকের কৃতিত্ব অভিষেক না কাড়লে আর কে কাড়বে?) *** কিন্তু আপাততঃ সব বিষয়বস্তু শেষ। দেরিতে পৌঁছলে যা হয় আর কি - সবাই আগেই ঝপাঝপ্‌ সব লিখে ফেলেছে। সবকিছু কভার্ড, কিস্যু বাকি নেই। কয়েকটা লিঙ্ক না দিলে একটু অপরাধবোধ হচ্ছে, তাই আগে কর্তব্যটুকু সেরে ফেলি (চলচ্চিত্রকার বা পেশাদার সমালোচকদের বলা কথাগুলো আর দিলাম না, ধরে নিচ্ছি ওগুলো সবাই পড়েছে)। অর্ণব (গ্রেটবং) দীপ্তকীর্তি এবং দীপ্তকীর্তি কুন্তলা তন্ময় প্রবীরেন্দ্র এরা পাঁচজনে মিলে যেটুকু যা লেখার সব লিখে দিয়েছে, আমার আর কিছু লেখার বাকি থাকে না এরপর। তাই, অগত্যা, ঋতুপর্ণর সবথেকে কম আলোচিত সিনেমাগুলোর একটা নিয়ে লিখি বরং - যেটা নিয়ে লোকে বিশেষ মাথাটাথা ঘামায়নি বলেই আমার ধারণা (এই কথাটা পড়েই হয়ত লোকে মার্‌মার্‌কাট্‌কাট্‌ করে তেড়ে আসবে, কিন্তু সে আসুকগে)। *** সব চরিত্র কাল্পনিক  প্রথমবার দেখেছিলাম আইনক্সে। সেদিন কোনোকারণে বেশ অন্যমনস্ক ছিলাম, বিশেষ মন দিয়ে দেখিনি। স্পষ্ট মনে আছে বিপাশা বসুর খ্যাস্‌খ্যাসে ডাব্‌ড্‌ গলা (পরে জেনেছি ওটা সোহিনী হালদারের গলা - কিন্তু তাতে আমার বিশেষণটা বদলাবে না) শুনে বেশ ঘাবড়ে গেছিলাম, যদিও এতদিনের অভ্যেসের পর চমকানোর বিশেষ যুক্তি ছিল না। ব্যাপারটা আরো অদ্ভুত লেগেছিল কারণ বিপাশার বেশিরভাগ সংলাপ ছিল ইংরিজিতে, আর বিপাশার ইংরিজি উচ্চারণ মোটেই বাজে নয় (বাংলা উচ্চারণ কেমন সেটা সম্পর্কেও কোনো ধারণা নেই)। বিপাশা কিছুদিন পর যখন বিবৃতি দিয়েছিলেন যে ডাব্‌ করার দরকার ছিল না, আর আমার এই অভিযোগটা বেশ ঠিকঠাক মনে হয়েছিল। সত্যি বলতে কি, চিরঞ্জিতের গলায় সব্যসাচী ('বাড়িওয়ালি') এবং ঋতুপর্ণ ঘোষের অনেক সিনেমার আরো নানান্‌ ডাবিংএর রহস্যভেদ আমি কখনওই করে উঠতে পারিনি। যাক্‌গে, বড় বড় লোকেদের বড় বড় ব্যাপার বোঝার মত বুদ্ধি আমার নেই। আমি নিশ্চিত যে 'সত্যান্বেষী' রিলিজ করলে খারাপই হত। ব্যোমকেশ বক্সী বেঁটে হলে সে সিনেমা দেখার যোগ্য হয় না। যত বড়ই অভিনেতা হোন্‌, পঙ্কজ কপূর ফেলুদা হলে জমত? ইন্টারনেট ঘেঁটে পাওয়া ছবি (গুরুত্বপূর্ণ তথ্য - বিদ্যা বালনের উচ্চতা পাঁচ ফীট চার ইঞ্চি।) যাক্‌গে, মূল বক্তব্যে আসি। সব চরিত্র কাল্পনিক দেখে (এবং দেখে বিশেষ সুবিধের না লাগার পর) একটা ছোট্ট অপরাধবোধে ভুগছিলাম। নানান্‌ সূত্রে সিনেমাটা সংগ্রহ করে গত কয়েক বছরে কয়েকবার দেখে ফেলেছি। আর দেখে বুঝেছি, পপকর্ন খেতে খেতে পেছনের সীটের ছিঁচকাঁদুনে অবাঙালি শিশুর চিৎকার শুনতে শুনতে আর লাথি খেতে খেতে দেখাটা মোটেই উচিত হয়নি। লম্বা ব্যাখ্যায় যাওয়ার আগে আসল বক্তব্যটুকু সেরে ফেলি<semic> সব চরিত্র কাল্পনিক  নিঃসন্দেহে ঋতুপর্ণর সবথেকে, আন্ডাররেটেড সিনেমা। সেরা সিনেমাই বলে ফেলতাম (হ্যাঁ, যীশু সেনগুপ্ত থাকা সত্ত্বেও), কিন্তু কীর'ম একটা বাধছে, মূলতঃ আমি ঋতুপর্ণর সব সিনেমা দেখিনি বলেই (এমন কি চিত্রাঙ্গদা ও না)। আমি সিনেমাটিনেমা বিশেষ বুঝি না। আমার সীমিত বুদ্ধিতে বলে, সিনেমা তিন রকমের - ভাল, খারাপ, আর কান্তি শাহ্‌র সিনেমা। আর সেই সংজ্ঞা মেনে  সব চরিত্র কাল্পনিক  হল একটা ভাল সিনেমা। একটা রীতিমত ভাল সিনেমা। এবার মূল প্রসঙ্গে আসি। যে আমি সারা জীবনে সুকুমার রায় বাদ দিয়ে সাকুল্যে হয়ত পঞ্চাশটা কবিতাও পড়িনি (যা পড়েছি তারও বেশিরভাগই রবীন্দ্রনাথ-জীবনানন্দ), তার হঠাৎ  সব চরিত্র কাল্পনিক  এত ভাল লাগার যুক্তি কী (বিশেষতঃ যেখানে সিনেমাটা আদ্যোপান্ত কবিতানির্ভর)? বিশেষতঃ যেখানে সিনেমাটা ঠিক ফীল-গূড বলতে যা বোঝায় তা নয়। আগেই বলেছি,  সব চরিত্র কাল্পনিক  পপকর্ন খেতে খেতে দেখেছি, কিন্তু দোসর বা দ্য লাস্ট লিয়র ও সেভাবেই দেখেছি, কাজেই সেটা কোনো যুক্তি নয়। আমার মানসিকতার সঙ্গে  সব চরিত্র কাল্পনিক -এর মিলও নেই বিশেষ। আমি টুকটাক লিখি, কিন্তু তার মধ্যে বিশেষ গভীরতা নেই, সর‍্যিয়ল জিনিসপত্র বুঝিটুঝি না, কিছু মোটা দাগের রসিকতাকে ভাল বলে চালানোর চেষ্টা করে নানান্‌ ব্লগপোস্ট লিখি। আমি নেহাৎই গদ্যপন্থী, কবিতা-টবিতা আমার নাগালের বাইরেই থাকবে আজীবন<semic> ডোরেমন দেখেটেখে বড়জোর নবিতা অবধি দৌড় আমার। অনেকেই বলেছে পর্দায় জয় গোস্বামীকে আবৃত্তি করতে দেখে তাদের গায়ে রীতিমত কাঁটা দিয়েছে। আমার মোটেই এসব হয়নি। তাহলে কেস্‌টা কী? গুছিয়ে বলার চেষ্টা করি, যদিও ঘেঁটে যাওয়ার প্রভূত সম্ভাবনা আছে। সিনেমা আর কবিতা দুটো মারাত্মক শক্তিশালী মাধ্যম। কোন্‌টার জোর বেশি বলা কঠিন, তাও যেহেতু আমি কবিতাটবিতা বিশেষ বুঝি না, আমার পাল্লা সিনেমার দিকে অনেক বেশি কঠিন। আমি নিশ্চিত যে অনেকে উল্টোটা বলে বসবে। তবে একটা বিষয়ে সবাই একমত হবে - দুটো মাধ্যমের মধ্যে আকাশপাতাল পার্থক্য আছে। গড়পরতা সিনেমার মুখ্য উদ্দেশ্য দৃশ্যের মাধ্যমে মানুষের কাছে পৌঁছনো। সিনেমা মানুষকে দেখতে সাহায্য করে, দর্শক দেখতে না চাইলেও তাকে চোখে আঙুল দিয়ে দেখিয়ে দেয় যাতে সে মিস্‌ না করে। বেশিরভাগ কবিতার উদ্দেশ্য এর ঠিক উল্টো। তারা দৃশ্য বোনে না - তারা শুধু কিছু অনুভূতি আর শব্দ ছুঁড়ে দেয়, দৃশ্য গড়ে নেওয়ার দায়িত্ব হয়ে ওঠে পাঠকের নিজেদের। তা বলে কি সিনেমার অন্তর্নিহিত অর্থ নেই?

Here is another entry to a contest where I need to conjure up something on the following topic: After World War III, the female survivors decide that, as men caused the war and did most of the fighting, it is simply too dangerous to allow them to be in control of the governments any longer. Men are banned from government and military service and, after a few years, banned from voting, having an education or having a job outside the home. A young boy, depressed by his limited prospects at home, decides to pose as a girl so he can join the navy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Disclaimer : This story may end up hurting sentiments of sexists. However, I would please, please request you to note the fact that the topic is sexist in itself, and hence writing a a non-sexist story on a sexist topic is, well, beyond my scope. If you are a sexist and do not like sexist stories based on sexist plots, you should skip reading the rest of the post. I was a bit circumspect, given that I have to write a story involving women, navy, wars, and future - four topics that I am blissfully unaware of. Now that I have mentioned 'sex' seven times in the paragraph above, my tension has eased off a bit. Sex eases stress, I've been told. Let me set the ball rolling now. *** Srinivasan was a fraud. When you come across the word 'fraud', you probably get an image of someone who looks like an insurance agent, carries a battered leather folio, wears buttoned-up full-sleeved cheap shirts that are not tucked inside the ancient grayish trousers, and adorns a permanent four-day salt-and-pepper stubble. No, Srinivasan was not a fraud in that mould. He was a fraud with class. He looked suave, snazzy, sexy, stylish, smooth, sleek, sensuous, and several other similar adjectives that begin with an S. These, however, weren't qualities that Srinivasan was proud of. He knew that the S's were unnecessary attributes, and though they brought him women on a frequent basis, he knew they were useless qualities unless he stuck to the real  s-adjective. Smart. Smartness was Srinivasan's forte. He could outsmart any person he knew, and we are not talking rocket science or advanced topology here. He also specialised in impersonating people, which, when combined with smartness, became a tool potent enough to hoodwink any person. Only that it was different this time. Very different. He had got the better of a cohort of people. Women, actually. *** It was, well, a long tale. To cut things short, after the two-year long World War III had ended, the women took their time off from pedicures and eyebrow-plucking, and took to mundane events - including administration. They took a decision - despite vehement protests from men - to strip men of all their rights. It did not help that the male population had gone down drastically after the war, thereby resulting in a protest that turned out to be as feeble as a muted limbless chihuahua on sedatives. They were captured and shown their place. They had to be confined to home and household duties<semic> they were deprived of education of all sorts<semic> they were banned from entering Government and military services<semic> and they could be used by the fairer sex in the most unfair of fashions - which was when the heterosexual women contemplated reproduction or watched pre-World War porn. Things became the toughest for those who were used to the pre-World War comforts, or at least the equality. Srinivasan was one of them. He simply knew he had to find a way around this. He thought hard, rehearsed with a passion, and eventually found a perfect solution. He was so excited that he had almost shouted out 'Eureka!', but abstained when he was reminded of the horrible music that accompanies the filling of a bottle from an Aquaguard machine. *** He had taken out time to buy some apparel to turn up for the interview. Now, given the fact that he could not leave the house being dressed as a man (online shopping was, of course, banned for men), there was only one option left. He had to leave the house as a woman to shop for a woman. Economists and others have classified concepts like these as vicious circles. Vicious circles weren't good enough to hold back Srinivasan, though: not only circles, he was good at going around vicious squares, triangles, rectangles, in fact, vicious geometry boxes. He could have picked the pocket of a vicious Euclid and a vicious Pythagoras and would have made them blame each other. He was that kind of a person. Anyway, he had stolen his mistress' lipstick and a few strange-looking tubes that rested innocently next to her bathroom mirror. He had read the instructions carefully, applied each and every one, and had put them back. The woman at the supermarket had not suspected him. He bought clothes, undergarments, and a basic collection of cosmetics. He had a checklist with him, and had ticked the items one by one until he was satisfied. He loved checklists. Had this been an earlier era, he might have worked as an HR and used phrases like 'paradigm shift'. Sigh. He still required a false identity, though. That was easily obtained. He had felt a sudden warm gushing of blood down his veins as he slit that 21-year's throat down the dark alleyway down to the barn. He had murdered before, but this had been different. This had been revenge against injustice. He had found perverse pleasure as he had watched the girl's voiceless body go down in silent spasms, only to be still afterwards. Stripping the girl, slicing her into bits, and throwing them to the pigs' pen had been rather easy afterwards. The good things about pigs is the fact that they eat anything and are perpetually hungry, somewhat like politicians. He had obtained her AADHAAR card, and putting all his experiences of his days of faking passports into use, he had managed to replace her name with his. It had been a cakewalk after that. *** Getting through had been easy. Sharing room with ladies, showering with them, watching them in their thongs, and getting them to brush their flesh against his during one of those booze-parties had been worth the experience. Controlling his lust had not been, though. He had to remind himself on a consistent basis that he had been at the navy with a mission. It had been about getting back at them . It had been about getting out of that hellhole. It had been having a life, for a change. No, he had to get over his lust. The women, on the other hand, had been quite adventurous at the islands. They had come back tipsy, smelling of stale tobacco, cheap alcohol, and stories of male escorts who they had paid to fulfill various fantasies.  \n",
      "Abhishek's blog Abhishek's blog skip to main | skip to sidebar Facebook Wednesday, June 5th, 2013 All the characters of the myths are going to swear on Rituparna, except me. All the writings that have been written, all the movies, songs, scriptures, 'diamond rings', 'eye-sand', the evolution of the prasenjit from the use of Rabindranath Tagore, and the silence-tally of Bangla cinema in the nineties There is a fair debate about Kiran Kher's neck and controversy about the national award surrounding him - it all happened. . Amitabh-Jaya-Abhishek-Aishwarya may not have seen any strange example of handling four, but it is too late to be too much. (For the benefit of Sukanya and my brother, I have recently learned that Abhishek Bachchan has tweeted - Just realised that Ritu da was the only director that my family has all work with individual. Pa- last lear, Ma- sunglasses ... and ivorya- choker bali, raincoat and me- Antarmahal <semic> Who will pick an anointing of the debut of anointing?) *** But for now all the content is finished. What is and what happens if you arrive late - everyone has already written all of a sudden. Everything is covered, the key is not left. If you do not give some links, it is a little guilt, so do not forget about it (I do not say the words made by film stars or professional critics, assuming they all have read). The greatness of the great (great-great) and Kantla Tanmay Prabrendra of the house, which they wrote in all of the writing, I have no other writing left then. So, inevitably, I write about one of the least discussed movies in Rituparno - that is why I think that people did not sweat their headwashers, (that is, they will read the word, but they will come back). *** I saw all the characters imagined for the first time at Aynx. I was not quite ashamed that day, I did not look very carefully. It is clear that Bipasha Basu was very upset when she heard the news of the neck of her neck (later she knew that Sohini Haldar's throat - but she did not change my adjective), although it was not a special argument for shining after the practice. It was more strange because most of Bipasha's dialogue was in English, and Bipasha's English pronunciation is not bad at all. (There is no idea about how to pronounce Bangla). Bipasha later gave a statement after a few days that it was not necessary to dub it, and my complaint seemed quite right. In fact, I have never been able to raise the mystery of Nanan Dabing in many movies of Sabyasachi ('Landwali') and Rituparno Ghosh in the neck of Chiranjit. In Jacob, I do not have any intelligence to understand big things about big people. I am sure that the release of 'Satyavanabashi' was bad. When Bomakesh boxy is beaten, he is not able to watch the movie. How big is the actor, Pankaj Kapoor Feluda if agreed? The pictures found on the internet (important information - Vidya Balan height five feet four inches). Zakhe, come to the original address. Seeing all the characters imagined (and after not being able to see special privileges) were suffering from a little guilt. Nana has seen several times in the last few years collecting the movie. And after seeing it, it was not necessary to see the non-Bengali baby screaming and sniffing the back seat to eat popcorn. Before going into a long explanation, the original statement is to be read <semic> all the characters are fictional, undoubtedly the most famous, underrated movie. I would say the best movie (yes, despite being Sengupta), but Kir'am is stopping, basically because I did not see all the movies of rituals (such as Chitrangada and not). I do not understand cinematima special In my limited sense, the movie is of three types - good, bad, and Kanti Shah film. And all the characters are fictitious in terms of that definition, a good movie. A really good movie. Now come to the original context. That is, I have not read fifty poems in my entirety (except the Sukumar verdict) throughout my life (mostly of Rabindranath-Jibanananda), what is the logic of all its character fiction so good (especially where the movie is poetic from the beginning)? Specifically, where the movie is not exactly what the fiddle-gud is. As mentioned earlier, all the characters have seen to eat imaginary popcorns, but have seen the collaborator or the Last Learer and so on, so it is not an argument. My mentality does not match with all the characters imaginary. I write a chatter, but there is no special depth, not knowing the things in the baggage, but trying to play some pompous jokes, write nanob blogpost. I am a poet, poetry and poetry, I will always be beyond my reach. <Semic> Derroman shows me the race till the beginning of my life. Many said that when watching the story of Joy Goswami reciting the screen, the thorns wound on them. I did not do that at all. What is the key? I try to make it happen, although there is a lot of potential to get around. There are two deadly powerful media in the movie and poetry. It is difficult to say more about the answer, even though I do not understand poetry, my scalp is much more difficult to film. I'm sure many would say the opposite. But one would agree on one thing - there is a sky-sky difference between the two mediums. Reaching out to the people through the main objective of the whole movie. The movie helps people to see, even if the audience does not want to see them, they show them with their eyes so that they do not miss. Most poems are just the opposite. They do not sneak the scene - they just throw some feelings and words, the responsibility of creating the scene became the readers themselves Does not the movie have the meaning of the underlying meaning? There is a miracle. But only the money - the viewer is watching the eyes of the blood of the eyes. Poetry throws a pair of challenges - Look at what you are trying to show before (if there is no guarantee to see it properly), then, if there is any danger then try to understand. Perhaps this is why poetry is not such a popular medium like cinema. Because of that heavy, heavy, black, hard, iron key of the poem, my silence will be just outside the boundaries of people who are engaging in the simple purse. No, I did not sing Shiva's song to roast rice. One of the keys to the emoticon of all the characters' imagination is the key - a simple match of poetry and cinema. Whenever there is a mix of movie poetry, or poems, all the alternatives are made before it can be understood - neither can be separated from each other in any way. All characters have been able to draw poetry on the screen (not increasing it, not saying it) in fictional. The subject of that poem again is poetry - and to illustrate this second-level poem, she again used cinema to give a face to the flesh. (If the above paragrapha is not understood even after two or three times, then it is not my fault. <Semic> The blame is Rituparnar itself.) Am I Indranil Mitra? No I'm not an indianil friend But I do not have the option to deny that some of the indelible ally are sitting in between me. However, it may be in the least - especially where the Bengali wax has penetrated, that the thrust-beard, the red eye, the sleeping glass artist, means the seven murders of his own. And here all the characters have re-imagined. The depth and extent of the sensation of Indranil is both deadly, but in the personal daily life, he is totally useless like a Bengali poet. But despite the temptation, Rituparno has been impersonal, not only tried to bias Indranil, but the sympathy of the audience, but also turned towards Radhika. Interestingly, in the screenplay, Indraneel did not shorten his poetry - but rather showed the strange control of personal and professional life quite smoothly. There are also trains. This train is not a train of Panchali, completely other flavors. Almost every shot is taken from the train, and the simulacimental symbolic rhythm with the screenplay. A second narrative of the train movie running alongside the eternal journey of Radhika. There are poems in it (which I do not understand, but if someone recites it in a lovely voice, it does not feel bad). There is a wonderful poem written about Nandar Mai Prebala, which, like what I hear, was like empty of empty stomach. There is a screenplay given by the past-present-souriyal - the thought that was beyond the hand of the Bengali director till now. Though it may have been thinking about time wrap, however, it is not so modern, and if it is modern then at least it is not poetical. And there is Kaziri Roy. Kazila Roy could have been Banlata Sen or Nira, but she is more perfect <semic> She is probably not real <semic> Not just indecent, all the men have died out. Kazi Roy is a woman who has been caught in the fire and the obstacles in the distance and time, the man has been in the fire for ages, like the insect. The woman, her lover, her ancestors, her mother-in-law, but despite all the hunger of Indranil, she has not been caught, she has not been caught. Radhika Kavari wanted to be, maybe or never, without knowing herself or herself, has never been or did not - but Indranil has been left behind. And then, when Radhika discovered that Indraniel's poems were written on the basis of her own poetry, initially angry, she gradually realized that one of Indranil's poems was the inspiration she herself had. And so, after all - after the end of the realm - so that Radhika does not have to stop junking the bedkawar with Katari standing in the realm of imagination, anywhere <semic> Adar Radhika in the touch of nature is so easy <semic> She became herself by Kabiri - and sometimes with Katari He wants to conquer Indrnilake Then who is the existence of Shearor? Radhika once again went back to the past, and wanted to understand repeatedly how to read Indraneel's poetry from everyday events, poetry's source <semic> Radhika gradually realized their relation, sexuality, depth - Radhika could not understand even though she understood the senses. And here's the rhythm conquest. Not only the mix of imagination with the character of flesh and blood, it has also made possible all the characters in the imaginary. Bengalis saw this thing in poetry, but they did not see in the movie - maybe they could not see them. Puked by Abhishek Mukherjee at 02:33 Email This BlogThis!

    "    The function iterates through the URLs, identify the URL of the above kind then separates them.\n",
