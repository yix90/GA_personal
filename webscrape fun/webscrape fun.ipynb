      "I often speak clearly, and don’t leave much to be implied (unless I’m being sarcastic of course), and often don’t have an agenda unless I’m trying to attack those who hold views that differ from mine. I respect the past, present and future equally.\n",

      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "Strangely enough, people who are overly emotional annoy and confuse me, and I often don’t know what the hell to do with them, but that usually only applies to adults, with kids, I know exactly what to do. I value strength over weakness, that’s for sure, yet I sympathize with the “underdog”, and the homeless and refugees etc.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "I am admittedly very thin skinned though with regards to criticism, but also have good self control (more often than not), and can easily refrain from insulting others even if they deserve it. I’m a pretty generous person however, and often find it hard to both say “no” or criticise others.\n",

      "Here is where things get quite complicated. I apparently got a fairly even split between the two: 46% in favour of Judging, and 54% in favour of Prospecting. It’s pretty confusing actually.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "Here’s the thing, I am super organized when it comes to my writing on Quora especially. If you look through my past few answers (or even this one), you’ll notice that I have my sub-titles and keywords in bold, have actively used chapter dividers, and have used paragraphs rather than writing all my stuff in one big slab of text.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "The same does not apply to real life however, and I rarely fold my clothes or make my bed (except for when I annoyingly have to). I procrastinate like hell, and often agree with the notion of “good enough” rather than being a perfectionist. But this doesn’t apply when I’m doing things that I actually like, and on the contrary will even attempt to be a perfectionist.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "I improvise more often than not, and am often indecisive. However, when it’s regarding something serious, then I often make a 360 point turn, and could easily make up my mind now faster than the speed of light. I am pretty lazy though, and find it annoying to have to commit to anything even in relationships. I often break my promises, and change my mind.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "However, I can also easily fit under a schedule, and listen to orders/commands without question, and can easily thrive under a restrictive setting. My desk is also usually tidy funnily enough, and my clothes? Always neat and tidy, straight and ironed.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "I value flexibility, but also like to plan ahead in advance in the long term. But I do “live in the moment”.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "For the record however, I usually stick to the less popular, but possibly more scientific “Big 5” Personality Test, which I will also put here:\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "Regardless, take them all with a grain of salt. It’s not healthy to overthink this.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "In addition, I always second guess myself anyway. It might be entirely possible that I think one way, but act another.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "When I was doing the test, almost every single question was confusing to me honestly (no it’s not a English problem, my English capabilities are highly advanced), if I had to guess, I’m sure I picked some options then and there which at the time sounded correct, but were not in fact.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "How do I perceive myself? Well I’m not as disagreeable nor closed minded as the image above suggests, that’s for sure, not sure what drugs I was on when I was doing that particular quiz. The Big 5 was a percentile ranking though, placing me relative to others in the United States, so that’s important to know.\n",

I work at it from both ends-- I compare them to different type descriptions, and I also ask myself whether they're more E or more I, more T or F, etc. To continually refine my understanding, I like to read different authors and bloggers and see how they describe each of the types.

I chose a major (engineering) in which I thought it wouldn't be as important to be a person in order to be successful. After a year and a half in college I realized that in fact I was very interested in people and I moved into a liberal arts major (history).\n",

      "But it wasn't until I was in my 30s (I think?) that I found out about personality typing. When I realized I was an ENTJ so many things made sense, and I started to appreciate my personality. I felt like I had stumbled on a decoder that helped me to understand why everyone else seemed so different from me and why it was so easy for me to misunderstand and to be misunderstood. And why so often it seemed that people were afraid of me! It helped me to appreciate every person, to be compassionate toward everyone, and even to be an advocate for others when they were having problems with relationships or fitting into groups.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________________\n",
      "And \"fitting into groups\" is paramount to an ENTJ-- things have got to get done, important things, and it's crucial to understand what part each person has to play. It's important that people be placed into roles that fit their personality. I love helping people understand and appreciate themselves.\n",

      "I understand that MBTI is not everything, that it has limitations, that it can be misused. In particular, too many people's first introduction to it is with these free tests online. Almost by definition, those tests are going to be more useful for some types than others. But I believe it can be very useful for understanding the drastically different ways that individuals think and communicate and solve problems, and I believe it is an essential item for any ENTJ's leadership toolkit.\n",
